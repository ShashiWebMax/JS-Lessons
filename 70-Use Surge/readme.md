# Use Surge to share your project with the world

Surge is a static web publishing tool that allows you to publish your project to the web with just one command. It's a great way to share your project with the world!

## Getting Started

To get started with Surge, you'll need to install it globally using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global surge
```

## Usage

Once you have Surge installed, navigate to your project folder in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
surge
```

This will prompt you to log in or create an account. Once you're logged in, you'll be asked to specify the directory you want to publish. By default, Surge will publish the current directory, but you can specify a different directory if you want.

After you've specified the directory, Surge will publish your project and provide you with a URL where it's hosted. You can share this URL with anyone to give them access to your project.

- `surge login` - Log in or create an account
