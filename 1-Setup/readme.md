# Javascript Tutorial Series Introduction
*DP Education - Coding School*

## what is Javascript?
Javascript is one of the most important programming language in web development. It can be used for both Server Side programming and client side programming. 

### Server Side programming

Server side programming is used to create the backend of a website. For example, when you open your web browser and type in a URL, the browser sends a request to the server. The server then processes the request and sends back a response. The server side code is responsible for processing the request and sending back the response. The response can be a webpage, a file, or a message. The server side code can be written in many different languages. Some of the most popular languages are PHP, Python, Java, and Javascript.

### Client Side programming

Client side programming is used to create the frontend of a website. The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with. The frontend is made up of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML is used to create the structure of the page. CSS is used to style the page. Javascript is used to add interactivity to the page. For example, when you click on a button, the button will change color. This is done using Javascript.

- This example page only uses HTML - [html_only.html](html_only.html)
- This example page uses HTML and CSS - [html_and_css.html](html_and_css.html)
- This example page uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript - [html_css_and_js.html](html_css_and_js.html) 

### ES6

ES6 is the latest version of Javascript. It was released in 2015. It introduced many new features such as arrow functions, classes, modules, and more. It is supported by all major browsers. You can learn more about ES6 here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp

### What we will be learning in this tutorial series

In this lesson series, we will be focusing on client side programming. We will be using Javascript to add interactivity to the page.


## Requirements:
 - **Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS**
   - If you don't know HTML and CSS, you can learn it by going through DP Education - Coding School HTML and CSS tutorials. After you have learned HTML and CSS, you can come back to this tutorial series to learn Javascript.
 - **Chrome web browser**
   - You can use any web browser, but I am going to be using Chrome for this tutorial. So if you want to follow along, you should download Chrome. You download Chrome here: https://www.google.com/chrome/ for free.
 - **Code editor (VSCode is recommended)** 
   - Any code editor will work, but I am going to be using VSCode for this tutorial. You can download VSCode here: https://code.visualstudio.com/ for free.

You can find additional details and code samples for each lesson in this tutorial in this github repository. 

## Project Setup
It is not a must to host our web pages in a web server and serve to the browser. We can simply open the html file in the browser and it will work.  
1. Create a folder for your project
2. Open the folder in VSCode
3. Create a file called `index.html`
4. Open the index.html file in VSCode

## Understanding Browser Developer Tools
Every modern web browser has a developer tools. The developer tools can be used to inspect the HTML, CSS, and Javascript of a webpage. It can also be used to debug Javascript code. Since we will be using Chrome for this tutorial, we will be using Chrome developer tools to debug our code in this tutorial series. You can open the developer tools by right clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect". You can also open the developer tools by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac.

### Console
The console is where you can see the console outputs and errors. You can also type in Javascript code and run it in the console. This is useful for testing out code before adding it to your project. You can open the console by clicking on the "Console" tab in the developer tools. You can also open the console by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + J` on Windows or `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac.
  



```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```
type the above code into the console and press enter. You should see `Hello World!` printed to the console. we are going to use this in the next tutorial to confirm that our script is working and see the order of execution.

### Tutorial structure
Each tutorial will have a folder with the name of the tutorial. Inside the folder, there will be a `readme.md` file with the tutorial content and other html and js files
