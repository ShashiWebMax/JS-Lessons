# Recommended setup and instructions for the tutorials
## Requirements:
 - Computer with Text editor (VSCode is recommended)
 - Chrome or Edge web browser
 - Live Server extension for VSCode *(Optional to easily preview the changes)*
 - Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS

  
## Setup:
1. Create a folder for your project
2. Open the folder in VSCode
3. Create a file called `index.html`
4. Open the index.html file in VSCode
5. Open the preview of the index.html file in Chrome or Edge. If you have the Live Server extension, you can right click on the index.html file and click `Open with Live Server`
6. Open the console in Chrome or Edge. (Right click on the page and click `Inspect` then click on the `Console` tab)


### Get started with Console log
`console.log(argument)` is a function that prints the value of the argument to the console. This is useful for debugging. You can use it to print the value of variables or to print a message to the console.

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```
type the above code into the console and press enter. You should see `Hello World!` printed to the console. we are going to use this in the next tutorial to confirm that our script is working and see the order of execution.

### Commenting
Comments are used to explain the code. Comments are ignored by the browser and are not executed. There are 2 types of comments in Javascript. Single line comments and multi line comments. Single line comments start with `//` and multi line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. You can use comments to explain what your code does or to temporarily disable a line of code.

```js
// This is a single line comment
console.log("Hello World!"); // This is also a single line comment

/* This is a multi line comment
   This is also a multi line comment
   This is also a multi line comment
*/
```

### Tutorial structure
Each tutorial will have a folder with the name of the tutorial. Inside the folder, there will be a `readme.md` file with the tutorial content and other html and js files
