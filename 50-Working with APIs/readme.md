# Working with APIs

In a previous lesson, we learned the basics of working with APIs. We used some free to use APIs to get data from the internet. However, we only scratched the surface of what is possible with APIs. It is difficult to find a free api that allows us to do the things like creating, updating, and deleting data. So in this lesson, we will create our own Mock API to learn how to do these things.

To create our own Mock API, we will use a software called [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/). It is a free and open-source API mocking tool. You should download and install it before we start. you should also donwload the environment file and import it into Mockoon.
