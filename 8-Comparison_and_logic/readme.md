# Comparison and logical operators
in this section we will learn about comparison and logical operators in JavaScript. These operators are used to compare values and perform logical operations.

## Comparison operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| == | equal to |
| === | equal value and equal type |
| != | not equal |
| !== | not equal value or not equal type |
| > | greater than |
| < | less than |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| <= | less than or equal to |

[Example](./index.html#L22-L35)


## Logical operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| && | logical and |
| \|\| | logical or |
| ! | logical not |

[Example](./index.html#L46-L58)

## Conditional (ternary) operator
The conditional operator assigns a value to a variable based on a condition.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ? | conditional |
| : | else |

[Example](./index.html#L68-L80)

## Nullish Coalescing operators
The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ?? | nullish coalescing |

[Example](./index.html#L90-L103)

## Optional Chaining Operator
The optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ?. | optional chaining |

[Example](./index.html#L113-L137)


## Type conversion
When you use different data types in JavaScript, it will try to convert the values before doing the comparison. This is called type conversion.

type conversion functions:
### explicit conversion
* `parseInt()` - converts a string to an integer.
* `parseFloat()` - converts a string to a floating point number
* `Number()` - converts a string to a number
* `String()` - converts a value to a string
* `toString()` - converts a number to a string
* `Boolean()` - converts a value to a boolean
