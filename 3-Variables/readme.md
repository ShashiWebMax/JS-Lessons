# Variables
variables are used to store data in memory. In Javascript, you can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. 
The `var` keyword is the old way of declaring variables, and the `let` and `const` keywords are the new way of declaring variables. 

The `let` keyword is used to declare variables that can be reassigned. 

The `const` keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

Javascript is a dynamically typed language. This means that you do not need to specify the type of the variable when declaring it. The type of the variable is determined at runtime.
[Example](index.html#L10)

## Types of variables
You can store different types of data in variables. The following are the some of the most common types that you can store in variables:
* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Object
* Array
* Function

[Example](index.html#L36)

we can perform operation on variables. if we attempt to perform an operation on a variable that is not of the correct type, Javascript will attempt to convert the variable to the correct type.

## converting variables
there are two ways to convert variables in Javascript:
* Implicit conversion
* Explicit conversion

### Implicit conversion
Javascript will implicitly convert variables when performing operations on them. For example, if you try to add a number and a string, Javascript will convert the number to a string and concatenate the two strings together.
[Example](index.html#L60)

### Explicit conversion
Javascript provides functions that can be used to explicitly convert variables. For example, the `parseInt()` function can be used to convert a string to a number. below are some of the most common functions used to convert variables:
* `parseInt()`
* `parseFloat()`
* `toString()`  
* `Number()`
* `Boolean()` 
* `String()`
