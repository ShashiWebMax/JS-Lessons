# Handling Images

As we all know we can upload images to our web server using file input. However, did you know that we can also get those input images and display them on the client side using JavaScript? In this guide, we will learn how to do that.

In this guide, we will learn how to:
- Get the image from the file input and display it on the page.
- Get the image from the file input and store it in the local storage.
- Get the image from the local storage and display it on the page.

at the end of this guide, we will create a simple customizable calendar that will allow the user to upload an image and display it on the calendar.
