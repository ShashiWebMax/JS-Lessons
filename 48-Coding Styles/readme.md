# Coding Styles

## What is a coding style?

As you already know, in JS programming we can achieve the same result in many different ways. However, it is important to write code that is easy to read and understand. This is where coding styles come in. A coding style is a set of guidelines that help you write code that is easy to read and understand. It is important to follow a coding style because it makes your code more readable and maintainable. It also helps you avoid common mistakes and bugs.

***Note:***
**In the lesson series I have been using many different coding styles. This is because I want to show you different ways to write code. However, in a real project, you should follow a single coding style.**

## Famous coding styles

There are many coding styles out there, but some of the most famous ones are:

- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

Doesn't matter which one you choose, the important thing is to be consistent and follow the guidelines. 

## Common coding style guidelines

Here are some common coding style guidelines that you should follow:

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- **Semicolons**: Use semicolons at the end of each statement.
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings.
- **Naming conventions**: 
  - Use **camelCase** for variables and function names. `let myVariable = 5;`
  - Use **PascalCase** for class names. `class MyClass {}`
  - Use **UPPERCASE** for constants. `const MY_CONSTANT = 5;`
- **Spacing**: 
  - Use a space after keywords (`if`, `else`, `for`, etc.), and after commas.
  - Use a space before and after operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, etc.).
  - When naming files and folders, use a hyphen (`-`) to separate words. For example, `my-file.js`.

You have the freedom to choose your own coding style, but it is important to be consistent and follow the guidelines.

## Best practices

Here are some good practices that you should follow:

- **Use descriptive names**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, etc. This makes your code more readable and understandable.
- **Write comments**: Write comments to explain your code. This makes it easier for others to understand your code.
- **Use meaningful whitespace**: Use whitespace to make your code more readable. For example, use blank lines to separate different parts of your code.
- **Use consistent naming**: Use consistent naming for variables, functions, classes, etc. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Use consistent formatting**: Use consistent formatting for your code. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Use es6 features**: Use es6 features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, etc. This makes your code more concise and readable.
- **Declare variables using let or const**: Use `let` or `const` instead of `var` to declare variables. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Use strict mode**: Use strict mode to catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.

## Strict mode

Strict mode is a way to catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. It is a special mode that you can enable in your code. To enable strict mode, you simply add the following line at the top of your code:

```javascript
"use strict";
```
